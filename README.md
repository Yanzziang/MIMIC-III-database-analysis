# MIMIC-III-database-analysis

This is a file which records the coding for analyst MIMIC-III database(https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic/).

We utilized these data in AWS EC2 service.

Due to policy, we couldn't download data content to local, so no data source there.   

My presentation(Japanese version) was also attached.

Thank you!
